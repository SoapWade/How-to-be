	<h1>Here Are Some Steps to Start Your Journey</h1>
	<h2>First up is Wardrobe</h2>
<h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Find a blue button up shirt that fits nicely. Make sure it's not too loose or too tight. Every week--ususally Mondays he wears the exact shirt in the picture above.
		Always wear a white undershirt</li>
		<li>Next get a pair of khakhis. They shouldn't be slacks, but the material of uniform pants.
		A straight cut that's not form fitting is best, but you could also do a skinny pair.</li>
		<li>A pair of black converse hightops are essential.</li>
		<li>Lastly, accessories include A leather belt and watch, odd glasses frames, and a key ring that's too big for the amount of keys you have.</li>
	</ol>
</h3>
	<h2>Now let's move on to Mannerisms or Actions</h2>
<h3>
	<ol>
		<li>When walking be sure to be as silent as possible. Oh never mind, your key ring gives you away just like a cat with a bell around his neck.</li>
		<li>Your natural talking voice should be casual and calm. You should never get angry, only frustrated.</li>
		<li>Be sure to never sit in a chair like a normal human being and never let both of your feet touch the ground when sitting.</li>
		<li>Always look like you have something to do, even when you don't. This is to keep students from approacing you.</li>
	</ol>
	<ul>
		<li>You should knit when you have free time if you have no other ways to look busy</li>
	</ul>
