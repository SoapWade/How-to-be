	<h1>Here Are Some Steps to Start Your Journey</h1>
	<h2>First up is Wardrobe</h2>
<h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Find a Sweater and put it over a t-shirt. The shirt doeasn't actually matter as you never take off your sweater.
		If it is too hot for sweaters, wear a button down--one of the three you own and always wear a white undershirt. 
		We don't need the "Green Undershirt Fiasco of March 2017" to happen ever again.</li>
		<li>Next get a pair of khakhis, preferrably slacks. They should fit your waist and baggy on the legs.</li>
		<li>A pair of dark brown or black dress shoes would be best for everyday wear--including casual days.</li>
		<li>Lastly, accessories include A leather belt, plain metal glasses, and that's about it actually</li>
	</ol>
</h3>
	<h2>Now let's move on to Mannerisms or Actions</h2>
<h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Tell kids to get to class as you wallk down the hallways</li>
		<li>Your natural talking voice should be loud and capturing, attention will be had by you. You should never get angry, only
		annoyed, this is an oppertunity to be funny and possibly loud, but also to lecture.</li>
		<li>Be sure to have a sense of humor and let kids have one too without letting it become disrespectful</li>
		<li>Always look like you have something to do, even when you don't. This is to keep students from approacing you.</li>
	</ol>
	<ul>
		<li>You should go on facebook and have heated conversations in the comments if there's no other way to look busy.</li>
	</ul>
